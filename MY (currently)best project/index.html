        <div class="line"></div>
        <p id="MP">Hi, my name is Abdullah Qazi. My birthday is on the 23rd of September. I live with my family, and I am the youngest on my mum's side of the family, eventhough I am one of the tallest. I like to watch anime and I also like science. In the future, I plan on becoming a scientist. In my previous school, I often recieved high marks for most of my subjects and one of my personal favourite subjects is science.

        <h5> Likes and dislikes</h5>
        <p>I like the beach and other popular places in the sun. I like to play: basketball, table tennis, cricket and most other sports that involves hitting a ball. I dislike: football and athletics (for personal reasons). I also dislike it when I am sleeping and someone opens the curtains revealing the sunlight which temporarily blinds me making my morning miserable. </p>

        <h4> My earliest memory(this is how the first part of my autobiography will start)</h4>
        <p>
            My earliest memory is of me waking up one day not remebering anything. This happened when I was 3 or 4, but as I walked around I regained my memories and eventually just carried on with my life.

            Thank you all for listening, I am sorry for any inconveniences and I would like to pass you all on too the next person.
